# Architecture Decision Records

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the Life app.

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences. ADRs help teams understand why certain decisions were made and provide historical context for future developers.

## Format

Each ADR follows this structure:
1. **Title**: Short descriptive title
2. **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded
3. **Context**: What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision?
4. **Decision**: What is the change that we're proposing or have agreed to implement?
5. **Consequences**: What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change?

## Index
