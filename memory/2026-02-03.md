## Life Monorepo - Fixed Nested Folder Issue

### Problem
- Repository `kienmai98/life-monorepo` had an accidentally nested `life-monorepo/` folder inside itself
- This was a migration artifact from earlier monorepo setup
- Contained duplicate project structure: `apps/`, `docs/`, `packages/`, `tools/`
- Also had 14,000+ accidentally committed files in `life-monorepo/apps/web/node_modules/` (playwright, vitest, react, zustand, etc.)

### Solution
- Fresh clone to `/tmp/test-clone` (local workspace was out of sync)
- Executed `rm -rf life-monorepo && git add -A`
- Committed: "Remove nested life-monorepo folder"
- Pushed to main: `43331cb`

### Result
- Repository now has clean structure at root level
- Working tree is synchronized
- No more duplicate files or nested folders

### Key Learning
When local workspace shows "clean" but remote has issues, do a fresh clone rather than fighting with git state.
