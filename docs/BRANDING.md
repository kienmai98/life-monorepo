# Life App Branding Guide

## Brand Name Analysis

### Option 1: Keep "Life" (RECOMMENDED)

**Pros:**
- Simple, memorable, and universally understood
- Broad enough to encompass all app features (calendar, tasks, money, notes)
- Already established brand equity
- Works well across all platforms and languages
- Short, easy to type and search for
- Evokes personal organization and self-improvement

**Cons:**
- Generic term, harder to rank in search
- Many existing apps use "Life" in their name
- May lack distinctiveness in a crowded market

**Verdict:** Keep "Life" with strong visual branding and unique positioning to overcome generic nature.

### Option 2: "LifeOS"

**Pros:**
- Suggests a complete operating system for your life
- More distinctive than just "Life"
- Appeals to productivity-focused users
- Modern, tech-forward positioning

**Cons:**
- Slightly more complex to say and spell
- "OS" suffix can feel cliché (overused in app naming)
- May intimidate non-technical users
- Could imply complexity the app doesn't have

**Verdict:** Good alternative if emphasizing productivity and system-thinking.

### Option 3: "Dailie" (or "Daylie")

**Pros:**
- Unique, brandable name
- Implies daily use and daily improvement
- Friendly, approachable feel
- Easier to trademark and rank for

**Cons:**
- Loses the "life" concept breadth
- May sound like a diary app specifically
- Requires spelling clarification (Dailie vs Daily)
- Less intuitive for new users

**Verdict:** Consider for a future rebrand or spin-off focused specifically on daily planning.

## Final Decision

**Primary Brand Name:** Life  
**Secondary/Tagline Usage:** "Your Life, Organized"  
**Rationale:** The simplicity of "Life" aligns with the app's minimalist monochrome design philosophy. Combined with strong feature naming and visual identity, it becomes distinctive.

## Brand Voice and Tone

### Voice Attributes

| Attribute | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Clear** | No jargon, no fluff. Say what needs to be said. | "Event saved" not "Your calendar entry has been successfully persisted to the database" |
| **Friendly** | Warm but not overly casual. Professional but not cold. | "Ready to plan your day?" not "INITIATE PLANNING PROTOCOL" |
| **Empowering** | Help users feel capable and in control. | "You're all caught up!" not "No pending items detected" |
| **Minimal** | Fewer words, greater impact. | "Saved" not "The file has been saved successfully" |

### Tone by Context

| Context | Tone | Example |
|---------|------|---------|
| Onboarding | Welcoming, encouraging | "Welcome to Life. Let's get you set up." |
| Success | Celebratory, brief | "Done!" or "All set!" |
| Error | Helpful, blameless | "Couldn't save. Try again?" |
| Empty State | Empathetic, guiding | "No events yet. Tap + to add your first one." |
| Loading | Neutral, brief | "Loading..." or "Just a moment..." |

## Brand Usage Guidelines

### Logo Usage

- Maintain clear space around the logo equal to the height of the "L"
- Never distort, rotate, or apply effects to the logo
- Use the monochrome version on light backgrounds
- Use the inverted version on dark backgrounds

### App Icon

- Simple geometric representation of "L" or calendar grid
- Monochrome: black icon on white background (or system adaptive)
- Avoid gradients, shadows, or complex imagery

### Typography

- **Primary:** System font stack (San Francisco on iOS, Roboto on Android, system-ui on web)
- **Fallback:** -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", Roboto, sans-serif
- **Weights:** Regular (400) for body, Medium (500) for emphasis, Bold (700) for headers

### Writing Guidelines

1. **Use sentence case for most UI text** (except buttons — see UI Text Standards)
2. **Avoid exclamation marks** unless celebrating a significant achievement
3. **Use contractions** for friendliness ("don't", "can't", "you're")
4. **Lead with the benefit**, not the action
5. **Never use all caps** for body text (only buttons with specific styling)

## Competitive Positioning

| Competitor | Their Position | Our Differentiation |
|------------|----------------|---------------------|
| Notion | All-in-one workspace | Simpler, life-focused not work-focused |
| Todoist | Task management | Broader scope (calendar, money, notes) |
| Mint | Personal finance | Part of complete life system, not standalone |
| Apple Calendar | Default option | Cross-platform, more features |
| Google Keep | Quick notes | Structured organization, better integration |

**Our Position:**  
*Life is the only app that combines calendar, tasks, notes, and money in a beautifully simple, monochrome interface that respects your attention and helps you focus on what matters.*
